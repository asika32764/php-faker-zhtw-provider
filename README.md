# Faker zh_TW Provider

Currently [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) has a [zh_TW provider](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker/tree/master/src/Faker/Provider/zh_TW) but still not release in newest stable version.

If we want to use zh_TW provider but do not hope to load unstable packages, we can use this repository instead, until Faker release a new version.
